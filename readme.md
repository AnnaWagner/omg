# Ontology for Managing Geometry (OMG)

The Ontology for Managing Geometry (OMG) is an ontology for describing geometry descriptions of objects. It provides means to support the application of multiple geometry descriptions of the same object as well as the description of the geometry evolution over time. The OMG is based the concepts introduced in the Ontology for Property Management (OPM) ontology. 

This ontology was created within the research project SCOPE, funded by the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy (BMWi).

## Contributing to OMG

The OMG ontology should be as static as possible. Software and use case specific extensions should be realised using the [File Ontology for Geometry formats (FOG)](https://github.com/mathib/fog-ontology), which can be found on GitHub.

For contributions to the OMG ontology, please use the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/tudaIIB/omg) (Mirror of the [GitLab repository](https://gitlab.iib.tu-darmstadt.de/Wagner/omg)).

The RDF literals in the Abox triples are dummies to make it more easily to visualize them as a graph.
